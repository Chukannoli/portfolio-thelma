						<h3>Bua: Hellestø</h3>
						<p>
							<b>Year:</b> 2023 <br>
							<b>Focus:</b> Tatched material <br>
							<b>Programs used:</b> Rhino, render, model 1:50 <br>
							<b>Subject:</b> Animism in Architecture <br>
							<b>Adviser:</b> Rolf Gerstlauer
						</p>
						<p>
							Bua offers free rental of outdoor gear, fostering inclusivity in outdoor activities and curbing overconsumption.
							To enhance surf equipment access at Hellestø beach, I suggest a permanent Bua house using the traditional Norwegian grindbygg method and eco-friendly straw facade, eliminating the need for extra land and providing a consistent location.
							This addresses the drawbacks of the previous truck rental service, enhancing user convenience.</p>

						<h3>Swampy</h3>
						<p>
							<b>Year:</b> 2022 <br>
							<b>Focus:</b> Community <br>
							<b>Programs used:</b> Rhino, render, model 1:50 <br>
							<b>Subject:</b> Radical Architecture <br>
							<b>Adviser:</b> Lisbeth Funck, Matthew Anderson
						</p>

							When thinking of Venice there is a lot of things that come to mind; the rich history, architecture, and culture. But in the laguna of Venice, there is also a very important eco system that not a lot of people think about: the swamp.
							Swamps and wetlands is an imperical part of the worlds ecosystem. They have many important functions, like absorbing toxins, cleaning water, and providing home for biodiversity. Without these areas the world would not survive, the earth would become uninhabitable for humans. What is more important for the comunity of humanity than perserving our collective home.
							In order to take care of the swamp, and underline the importance of this ecosystem, I want to build a swamp scanctuary. A place where enviromentelist can go to work with the swamp, and do workshops,as well as tourists can get educated about a part of the Venecian laguna not many people know about.

						<h3>Adaptable housing</h3>
						<p><b>Year:</b> 2022 <br>
							<b>Focus:</b> Appartment building <br>
							<b>Programs used:</b> Rhino, render, model 1:20 <br>
							<b>Subject:</b> Timber topping <br>
							<b>Adviser:</b> Ute Groba, Paola Garcia</p>

								In Tøyen, targeting the 19 to 34 age group experiencing frequent life changes, our project focuses on flexible apartments to accommodate diverse life stages.
								The design incorporates a non-load-bearing wall system, allowing easy size adjustments by joining or dividing units. With a uniform floor plan on all levels, residents can adapt their living space according to changing needs. The centralized layout ensures cohesion when modifying apartment sizes, and the flexible design allows for potential changes in the building's purpose in the future.

						<h3>Tranby</h3>
						<p><b>Year:</b> 2020 <br>
							<b>Focus:</b> Transformative interventions in Tranby <br>
							<b>Programs used:</b> Rhino, ArcGis, Autocad, Illistrator <br>
							<b>Subject:</b> Urbanism <br>
							<b>Adviser:</b> Halvor Ellefsen <br>
							<b>Colaborators:</b> Jetmir Vishi, Hege Socha, Kyrre Myreng
						</p>
							<p>
								This semester, our task was to transform Tranby through urban strategies. As a suburban area lacking urban character, we identified the main car road connecting Tranby as a focal point. Since this road is integral to residents' daily lives, serving as a route to work, Lier toppen mall, and forest trails, we aimed to enhance safety for pedestrians, promote walking and biking, and program specific areas to elevate the road's importance. Our vision was to encourage people to leave their cars, fostering more interaction and a sense of community.

						<h3>Earth Matters</h3>
						<p><b>Year:</b> 2023 <br>
							<b>Focus:</b> Earth as building material <br>
							<b>Programs used:</b> Rhino, model 1:50 <br>
							<b>Subject:</b> Constructive logic: earth matters <br>
							<b>Adviser:</b> Lina Broström, Andrea Pinochet</p>
							<p>
								My first master course at AHO focused on constructive logic, exploring the use of earth as a sustainable building material. 
								We studied a reference project, The Learning Hub in Singapore, emphasizing how architects added unique expressions to concrete. Intrigued by this, I experimented with molding techniques to create ornamented concrete, offering a contemporary aesthetic. For the latter part of the semester, tasked with designing a recycling building, I incorporated my newfound concrete insights. The structure features walls blending concrete and earth to reduce the carbon footprint, while timber constitutes the rest of the construction. 
								The design includes a central atrium for natural circulation.
